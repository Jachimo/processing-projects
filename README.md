# processing-projects

Personal repository for digital art projects in Processing.

Most of the code here is somewhat trivial, but sometimes the results are interesting.

## Dependencies

### Hershey Font

HersheyFont (https://github.com/ixd-hof/HersheyFont) is used to create single-stroke text that can be printed using a pen plotter.  To use it within Processing, the library (`HersheyFont.zip`) must be downloaded, uncompressed, and placed in the Processing `/library` directory.  This will resolve import errors.  Note that the top-level Github project for HersheyFont is not a valid Processing library!
